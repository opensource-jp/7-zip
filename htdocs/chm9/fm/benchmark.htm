<H1>Benchmark</H1>

<P>This form allows you to measure the performance of your computer.</P>

<P>There are two tests:<P>
<OL>
  <LI>Compression with LZMA method
  <LI>Decompression with LZMA method
</OL>

<P>The benchmark shows a rating in MIPS (million instructions per second).
The rating value is calculated from the measured speed, and it
is normalized with results of Intel Core 2 CPU with multi-threading option switched off. 
So if you have modern CPU from Intel or AMD, rating values in single-thread mode 
must be close to real CPU frequency.</P>

<P>You can change the dictionary size to increase memory usage.
Also you can change the number of threads.</P>

<P>The <B>CPU Usage</B> column shows the percentage of time the processor is working.
It's normalized for a one-thread load. For example, 180% CPU Usage for 2 threads
can mean that average CPU usage is about 90% for each thread.</P>

<P>The <B>Rating / Usage</B> column shows rating normalized for 100% of CPU usage.
That column shows performance of the one CPU thread. It must be close to real CPU frequency,
if you have modern CPU.</P>

<P>The <B>Total rating</B> shows averages of the compressing and decompression ratings.</P>


<P>Compression speed and rating strongly depend from memory (RAM) latency.

<P>Decompression speed and rating strongly depend on CPU integer operations.
For example, an Intel Pentium 4 has big branch
misprediction penalty (which is effect of long pipeline) and pretty slow
multiply and shift operations. So, the  Pentium 4 has pretty low decompressing
ratings.</P>


<P>Also the program checks possible errors. 
If the program shows some error message, in most cases it means that 
your RAM is defective. If so, don't use 7-Zip for
compressing data, since such errors can lead to data losses.</P>
