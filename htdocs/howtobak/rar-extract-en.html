Extracting the rar file
</h1>
<hr>
<p>
It has bundled the UnRAR of rar developer in 7-Zip, and supports decompression of rar file (extraction).
</p>
<h2>
The way to extract the rar file
</h2>
<p>
I can be done by the same procedure as in the 7z file or ZIP file decompression of rar files.
7-Zip, if it is associated with the rar file, can be viewed in the 7-Zip you can simply double-click the rar file.
</p>
<img src="extract-rar-file.png" alt="extract-rar-file" width="123" height="86">
<p>
7-Zip After starting by double-clicking on the rar file, you can check and select the contents of the file, and you're done deployed in "Deployment" button.
</p>
<img src="7zip-toolbar.png" alt="7zip-toolbar.png" width="477" height="94">
<p>
Navigate to the folder where the rar file is located in the 7-Zip on after you start the ,7-Zip may rar file type is not associated, select the rar file in question and (open) "Deployment" I just press a button.
</p>
<h2>
Rar file decompression of the command line
</h2>
<p>
Thawing of the command line is similar and 7z files or zip files.
I unzip or "x" in the "e" command.
</p>
<pre>"C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" x data.rar
</pre>
<p>
If (. Since the end of the file name) file extension is not to "rar", you want to do the decompression of rar format explicitly, you can specify the compression format in the "-t" option.
</p>
<pre>"C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" x -trar data
</pre>
<p>
There is no extension in the file or wrong, usually because it is automatically identified correctly, you will not turn this option.
</p>
<h2>
The way to extract the rar files that have been split
</h2>
<p>
You can open the rar files that have been split ~. Part1.rar, ~. Part2.rar, and. Part3.rar ~, in the state that I put in the same folder the rar all files that have been split, and ~. Part1 first . I double-click the rar file.
</p>
<img src="split-rar-file.png" alt="split-rar-file" width="330" height="74">
<p>
7-Zip is started, the contents will be displayed rar each file is automatically loaded.
Press the "expand" button the rest, you are finished to a folder of your choice expand it (copy).
</p>
<p>
In addition, part of the rar file that is divided is not enough, it will not be able to retrieve the file that is stored in the part.
Even in a state where open fragments other than the head, such as. Part2.rar ~, (do not include the part of the file fragments of others) that has entered independently in only a fragment thereof, if file, the file You can take out.
</p>
